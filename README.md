Vocabulapy
==============
Small game project using PyQt4 that prompts a word in English (or Spanish), and the player has to write the translation in Spanish (or English) in less than a specific amount of time, to get points. If he writes an incorrect answers or runs out of time he fails/loses points.

Ideas:
* timeout varies depending on word length and difficulty level
* different words for different difficulty levels
* score system
* get words automatically from the net (https://glosbe.com/a-api)
* levels with words from a specific topic (jobs, colors, vehicles...)
