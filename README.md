Vocabulapy
==============
Small game project using PyQt4 that prompts a word in English, and the player has to write the translation in Spanish in less than x seconds (timeout) to get points. If he writes an incorrect answers or the time runs out he fails/loses points.
Ideas to include:
* timeout varies depending on word length and difficulty level
* different words for different difficulty levels
* score system
* get words automatically from the Internet
* levels with words from a specific topic (jobs, colors, vehicles...)
